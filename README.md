# Hello World
## Goodbye World
<h2>Good day World</h2>

This is my *first commit*. This is my **second commit**! ***Third commit***!

This is ~~not good~~.

> These are the words of someone famous. It was super great. This is a blockquote style. 

Sometimes we need to write code for Git in a way that we can read it: 

```
git status
git add . 
git commit -am "this is a commit message"
```
